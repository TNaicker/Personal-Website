				<h3>A little bit about myself</h3>
				<p class="intro">Hey, my name is Tegan Naicker and I'm originally from South Africa. My family moved to America when I was 2 years old and I have been living here ever since, mainly in the east coast. I come from a family of computer programmers and web developers. Both my sisters and father work with web development and coding as their jobs so, I guess you could say naturally, I gained an interest in coding as well. I learned to code a little bit on my own by creating simple games in different languages, such as very simple platformers and pong. I found the only real way to motivate myself to learn was by doing it in ways that I enjoyed. I don't really have much to say in terms of hobbies aside from playing the guitar. In my free time I mainly just play video games. Mainly fighters and Overwatch. Below, I will list 3 of the games I play the most.</p>

				<!-- Overwatch -->
				<section class="col-1-3">
					<img src="Assets/Images/overwatch.jpg" alt="Overwatch logo">
					<p>Overwatch is probably my go to game when I want something to play for fun now. I started playing it since release, but took a bit of a break from playing it for 2 or 3 seasons. Just started playing it again a couple months ago and I now wonder why I even stopped playing it. Very fun FPS. Reminiscent of TF2.</p>

				SFV
				--><section class="col-1-3">
						<img src="Assets/Images/sfv.jpg" alt="Street Fighter 5 logo">
					<p>Street Fighter V. One of the oldest fighters ever made. I started playing street fighter in 2012 with SFIV. Although I feel 5 is boring now and tend to play it a lot less than other fighters...</p>
				</section><!--

				Guilty Gear
				--><section class="col-1-3">
						<img src="Assets/Images/guiltygear.jpg" alt="Guilty Gear logo">
					<p>Guilty gear has quickly become my favorite fighting game. It's a more fast paced fighter, which I tend to like more. I've just started playing it more often a couple months ago, but I have played it casually since 2016. Beautiful art style and great information/tutorials for beginners.</p>
