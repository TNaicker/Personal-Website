				<h3>My future goals</h3>
				<p>I will start out with my final goal. My final real goal is to ultimately obtain a career that utilizes the skills that I earn from this program. I've enrolled in the Galvanize web devlopment course to quickly and effeciently learn to code better. Since I enjoy playing and making games, I would love to secure a career that involves video games in some shape or form though. However, I enjoy coding and problem solving in general, the feeling you get from overcoming a problem you spend a long time on is unbelievably satisfying.</p>
